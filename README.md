# Peak in the Past

… is a strictly location-based short-video service with which you can immortalize yourself at ANY Location (even on top the mountains). It’s just like a summit book, a graved bark or the good old guestbook at a museum – but all in the cloud. Peek into the past and discover people and things from long ago.
